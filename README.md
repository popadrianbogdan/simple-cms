This bundle is part of the [Symfony Content Management Framework (CMF)](http://cmf.symfony.com/)
and licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

The SimpleCmsBundle builds on other Symfony CMF components. It provides a
solution that can easily map content, routes and menu items based on a single
tree structure in the content repository.

While the core CMF components focus on flexibility, the Simple CMS Bundle
trades away some of that flexibility in favor of simplicity.
